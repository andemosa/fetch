In this task, you will learn how to use the fetch API and also how to populate the DOM using JavaScript.
Using the rest countries API https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all, you are expected to get the list of all countries, and show details about each country. Feel free to use any form of display, be it a table or using cards, the choice is yours
There should be a form of loader to show that the data is being fetched
If there is an error when fetching the data, display a form of alert or notification telling the user what the error is
